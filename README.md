# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-CNN

The main objective of this project is to deliver an end product that receives input from user, use them to predict and classify and give them the results predicted by the neural network model. We create an application that accepts Chest X-Ray image as input from the user using upload button. The Pneumonia is predicted using the analysis button on the screen. The model is trained with the training dataset, which is loaded every time user uses it.
